## ✅ Prerequisites


### 👤 Required Accounts

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You need a Bittensor wallet registered on the subnet

- **Mainnet (netuid 114)** - SOMA Subnet

### 💰 Registration

```bash
# Create wallet if you don't have one
btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name <your_wallet>
btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name <your_wallet> --wallet.hotkey <your_hotkey>

# Or register on mainnet (requires stake)

## 🎯 Competition Overview

### 🏆 What You're Building

Miners participate in **various competitions** with different challenges and themes. Your solutions will:

1. 📥 Receive competition-specific tasks and requirements
2. 🔧 Implement solution that solve the given challenge
3. 🏆 Compete for the **best performing solution**
4. 🚀 **Winning solutions become MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**

## 📝 Writing Your Solution

### 🏗️ Solution Structure

Your solution must be a Python function with a `main()` entry point. The signature depends on the specific competition:

```python
def main(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Main entry point for your solution.
    
    Args and return types vary by competition.
    Check the specific competition requirements.
    """
    # Your solution logic here
    result = your_algorithm(*args, **kwargs)
    return result
```

> **📋 Note:** Always check the specific competition documentation for exact input/output requirements.
